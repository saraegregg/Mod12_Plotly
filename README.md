# Module 12 Challenge

---
## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
---

### Project Overview
Roza, a biological researcher in a microbiology laboratory, is studying bateria that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. She has theorized that the bateria she is searching for live in the human navel and has collected samples from people across the United States, resulting in a large dataset coded with an identification number for confidentiality. Roza has a partially completed dashboard that we now need to finish. 


### Challenge Objectives
The dashboard should include: 
    - a horizontal bar chart with the ten most abundant bacterial species,
    - a bubble chart with all of the baterial species represented by circles whose relative size reflects the ammount of bateria in their sample,
    - a gauge chart that displays the reported number of weekly navel washes, and
    -customizations to improve the appearance and functionality of the dashboard.


### Resources
**Data Sources**
- samples.json

**Software**
- Visual Studio Code 1.63.2

### Challenge Results
I customized several features of the dashboard including:
    - adding a background image to the "jumbotron"
    - changing the text formatting and color scheme
    - changing the page background and the gauge colors to fit the overall color scheme

When a filter box is cleared of text, that filter is also removed from the table. After removing any filters that may have been added, the entire table is displayed.
